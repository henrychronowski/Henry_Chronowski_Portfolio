# Henry_Chronowski_Portfolio/Ballast

Ballast is a short 3D horror game where you play as Meg, a marine biologist researching the biggest deep sea discovery of her life, as she struggles to regain control of her malfunctioning sub. Stealthily make your way around to collect the needed parts, but be careful not to step in the light or something outside might see you!

This project was done for the 48-hour Champlain College Creator Jam with a team of 10. The theme for the jam was 'Shadow', and we wanted to create a game where the player focused on lighting. I worked primarily on the graphics programming on this project, working on a variety of shaders and lighting techniques although only a few bits of my code made it into the final demo build.
