Infiltrate the evil Wasp HQ as the top secret agent Spyder. Use your webs to swing around, but avoid the laser beams in this 70s throwback. Use your webs to swing around on levels in your own way. Avoid the deadly laser beams and cameras to stay stealthy in this tricky platformer. Do you have what it takes to be a secret agent?

I worked on Spyder as the lead programmer for the final 6 weeks of my Game Production class in the Spring 2020 semester. The team for this game consisted of 8 people, with three programmers, two designers, two artists, and a producer. I primarily worked on the sound programming and bugfixing throughout the project, although the majority of my time was spent assisting the producer with management tasks and doing the task management for the programming team. This project was done entirely remotely after the campus was shut down and thus I learned a great deal about working and leading a team remotely, both from successes and failures. Although most of what we attempted in regards to working remotely throughout this project was an absolute failure that has allowed me to take those failures and apply them to numerous remote projects in the past several months and continue to iterate and learn better ways of working and leading in remote teams.
